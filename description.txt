This mod provides the Vault-Tec Workshop package for The Cheat Bunker.  As such, it requires both the Vault-Tec Workshop DLC and The Cheat Bunker to be installed.  This package brings the Vault 88 suit into the Cheat Bunker and provides the option to unlock the ability to use the Vault-Tec Workshop items (excepting the experimental pieces) in any Settlement without completing the DLC's main quest.

This is yet another mod which provides a relatively small amount of content and should be given a pass if your load order is filling up.
